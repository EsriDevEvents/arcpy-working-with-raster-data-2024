# Arcpy: Working with Raster Data

This repository contains the ArcGIS 3.2 Project with the Jupyter Notebooks and data used in the *Arcpy: Working with Raster Data* session at *2024 DevSummit*.

Clone this repository and open the .aprx project. The project already has the three demo notebooks open, as well as all associated data.

If you want to separately access the notebooks and the data, these are organized in the following way:


1. Notebooks: `DevSummit/PythonRaster/Notebooks`: Each notebook file is named in the following convention: Demo**N**_**Topic**.ipynb where **N** corresponds to the number of the demo and _Topic_ corresponds to what was demonstrated during that demo.
2. Data: `DevSummit/PythonRaster/Data`: Each Demo has its own folder, with input and ouput geodatabases where the data used on each is stored.

For any questions, please email Tania Lopez-Cantu, tlopezcantu@esri.com
